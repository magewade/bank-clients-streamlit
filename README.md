# **Bank Clients Prediction: Predicting Customer Acceptance**

This project is part of my Machine Learning course. In this project, I worked on a classification problem where the goal was to predict whether a bank client would agree to a banking offer based on various features. I used linear models, specifically Ridge Regression, to build and evaluate the model.

## **Overview**

This project involves building a predictive model using the bank clients dataset. The objective is to predict if a client will accept a banking offer based on a range of features, such as their demographic information, account details, and past behavior.

The Ridge Regression model was chosen due to its ability to handle multicollinearity, prevent overfitting, and provide regularization, making it ideal for this classification problem. Moreover, Ridge Regression is a simple and fast model, which makes it efficient for real-time predictions without requiring significant computational resources.

## **Model Overview:**

The model used to predict whether a client will accept a banking offer is based on** ** **Ridge Regression** , a linear model that adds an L2 regularization term to the linear regression cost function. This approach helps reduce overfitting and provides more stable predictions, especially when features are highly correlated.

### **Steps Involved:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   The first step was to analyze the dataset visually and statistically to understand the relationships between features and target labels. Correlations, distributions, and outliers were explored.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Data was cleaned and transformed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare it for the model.
3. **Model Training:**
   Ridge Regression was selected for training the model. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the regularization parameter.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using cross-validation, and various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC were calculated to assess its ability to generalize to new data.

## **How to Use the App:**

1. **Input Data:**
   Users can input the client's details such as age, account status, and other features via the Streamlit interface.
2. **Model Inference:**
   After entering the details, the model will predict whether the client will accept the bank's offer (i.e., the prediction will be either "Yes" or "No").
